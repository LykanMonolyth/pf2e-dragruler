# pf2edragruler

Integration of the Drag Ruler module (https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-drag-ruler) for Pathfinder 2e with support for the 3 action economy. 

## V3.0.0 (Foundry V11 only)

As of v 3.0.0 of pf2edragruler, the module is no longer under active development and many features have been removed for stability reasons. Older functionality may be available on older versions but no support will be offered and they are unlikely to function as expected on Foundry V11 or newer.

The current version of the module supports **only** these features:

- Colouring of Movement Ranges.
- Setting to Ignore Off Turn movement.
- Effects to set movement type.

The original readme file is duplicated below, however the contents apply **only** to versions prior to the latest.

### Original Readme

With simple action tracking, that can handle the restrained, immobilized, paralyzed, quickened, slowed and stunned conditions. 

Terrain Ruler (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/terrain-ruler) is required for difficult terrain to be recognized. And Drag Ruler now requires SocketLib (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/socketlib)

Either Enhanced Terrain Layer(https://github.com/ironmonk88/enhanced-terrain-layer) or Terrain Layer (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/TerrainLayer/) are supported as a means to place dificult terrain. Note: The latter two modules are mutally exclusive.
